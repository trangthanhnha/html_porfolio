<h1>The best movies according to Ms.Nha</h1> 
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar</h3>

<p></p>Avatar is indeed a complete cinematic experience, with cinematographer Mauro Fiore, music director James Horner and special effects maestro Joe Letteri joining hands with director/screenwriter James Cameron to create a strong and visually-stirring plea to save the world, before it is too late. And the only way the human species can do it is by abdicating its destructive tendencies. For Indophiles and Indian philosophy enthusiasts, Avatar is a whole treatise on Indianism, from the very word `Avatar' itself. Add to this the blue-skinned, monkey-tailed, god-like Na'vi race and the linkages could be endless

<h3>Pay it forward</h3>
<p>It's the film that I like best. It make us to think again, what we need to do in our life, and the encouragement to do good things is priceless. The movie’s underlying message is that positive change in the world doesn’t require grand gestures or extensive planning. Instead, people can promote social good in simple, yet effective, ways.</p>

<h3>The secret world of Alex Mach</h3>
<p></p>I love this film. A teenage girl, just starting junior high and living in a modern corporate community, is accidentally contaminated by a secret chemical product of The Plant. She acquires mysterious abilities that allow her to change her shape, move objects with her mind, and zap people and objects with small electrical charges. The owners of The Plant continually seek to find out which of the local kids has been contaminated so they can experiment on her, but their employees are less than competent and the search is comedic and futile</p>
